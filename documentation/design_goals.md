# Design Goals

## Problem Statement

Keeping track of notes, work item status, and GitHub notifications, and GitHub issues across many different apps is very difficult.

## Scope and Constraints

Initial project: a class library for managing work in progress and taking notes, with a terminal UI.

End-goal: a web tool for managing notes, reminders, GitHub issues, non-GitHub tasks, and processes.
